## Trial Simulation Application

This is a Shiny application demonstrating how the [R](https://r-project.org) statistical computing language and the [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) package enable a dynamic and efficient workflow to perform clinical trial simulations and explore results interactively.  You can view the application at [app.simworkshop.online](https://app.simworkshop.online).  If you would like to run the application locally on your system, follow this procedure:

### Setup 

1. Install [R](https://r-project.org) and the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) IDE for your operating system.
2. Download this repository to your local system. You can click the __Clone or download__ button on this page, or [clone the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).
3. Open RStudio and choose `File -> Open Project`.  Browse to the directory on your local system you downloaded the repository and open the `simapp.Rproj` file.
4. The R session should import the required packages for the application (this may take some time).  If the packages are not imported, type the following in the R console: `packrat::restore()`.

### Executing application

Once the packages have been downloaded, you can run the application by clicking the `Run App` button in the RStudio interface.
